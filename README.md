# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. They are primarily designed to work on Linux
(specifically Ubuntu) systems, but they're pretty portable and I've frequently
used them on CentOS and OSX systems.

Various parts stolen from [ted27/.files](https://github.com/ted27/.files) as
well as [sds/dot](https://github.com/sds/dot).

## Installation

Clone the repo

```
git clone git://github.com/Aaronneyer/dotfiles
```

Install.

```
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The install script is not currently in a full working order, as I need to get
it to play nicely with my new .vim submodule.
